    <h3>Development Notes</h3>
    <p>This is my first game designed and developed within 7 days. It is draft, simple, stupid but completed.</p>
    That's why I put it here. Because it means I started my game design and development travel officially.
    TBH, when I developed this game, I used a lot technics learnt from others, and I leaned a lot about how to start a project
    and work with others, except the skills of programming and project management.
    That's all, hope you enjoy it and can find more in my blogs.
